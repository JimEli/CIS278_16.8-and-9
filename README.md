Exercise 16.8 on page 755, C++ How to Program, 10/e, Deitel

Read 20 integers into an array. Next, use the unique algorithm to reduce the array to the unique values entered by the user. Use the copy algorithm to display the unique values.

Exercise 16.9 on page 755, Duplicate Elimination
Modify exercise 16.8 to use the unique_copy algorithm. The unique values should be inserted into a vector that's initially empty. Use a back_inserter to enable the vector to grow as new items are added. Use the copy algorithm to display the unique values.

Notes:
* Per typical, the majority of the program is involved with input and validation.
* Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141).
* Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of PCC CIS-278.
